!SLIDE
* Software engineering as taught in school doesn't reliably produce good software or control cost or produce software at all.
* The people that called it software engineering misunderstood two fundamental things:  software and engineering.
* Software engineering, first documented in 1968 was "start with a simulation, then through successive repetition through interlaced testing, the model ultimately becomes the software system itself"  TDD!!!
* Winston Royce wrote a paper about waterfall in 1970.  This paper is often misquoted.  This paper contained the first Figure showing the Waterfall method.  The line after the Figure said "I believe in this concept, but the implementation described above is risky and invites failure".  Also, "An implementation plan ... keyed only to these steps, however is doomed."

* "People like simple solutions, and they hear terms and map those terms  to things they already or think they already understand... and run with it without thinking about it"
* "For every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat and wrong." -- H.L. Mencken
* There is no kind of engineering where all we have to do is put something in one end and turn the crank.
* Cost is always an object in engineering.

!SLIDE
* "Engineering is not the art of constructing.  It is rather the art of not constructing: or, it is the art of doing well with one dollar what any bungler can do with two." -- Arthur Wellington
* In engineering, advances come from practitioners, not academia.
* "Software engineering is the science and art of designing and making, with economy and elegance, [...] systems so that they can readily adapt to the situations to which they may be subjected." -- Glenn Vanderburg

!SLIDE
* Models are not reality, they are an approximation of reality.
* Assumptions once true, but no longer true:
    * Code is hard to read
    * Code is hard to change
    * Testing is expensive
* Assumptions once believed, but were never true:
    * All engineering is like structural engineering
    * Programming is like building
    * Modeling and analysis
